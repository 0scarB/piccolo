Piccolo Projects
================

A Piccolo project is a collection of apps.

A project requires a `piccolo_conf.py` file. To create this file, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    piccolo project new

The piccolo_conf file serves two important purposes:

 * Contains your database settings
 * Is used for registering :ref:`PiccoloApps`.
